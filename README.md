# Project Contracts

This project includes several smart contracts that facilitate various functionalities within our decentralized application. Below is a brief description of each contract:

1. **Token Contract**: This contract is responsible for the creation and management of our custom ERC-20 token. It handles token minting, burning, and transfers between users.

2. **Crowdsale Contract**: This contract manages the token sale process. It allows users to purchase tokens during the crowdsale period and ensures that the funds are collected and distributed according to the predefined rules.

3. **Voting Contract**: This contract enables decentralized governance by allowing token holders to vote on important project decisions. It ensures that votes are counted accurately and that the results are implemented in a transparent manner.

4. **Staking Contract**: This contract allows users to stake their tokens in order to earn rewards. It manages the staking process, calculates rewards, and distributes them to the stakers.

5. **Oracle Contract**: This contract interacts with external data sources to provide real-time information to our smart contracts. It ensures that our contracts have access to accurate and up-to-date data.

Each of these contracts plays a crucial role in the overall functionality and success of our decentralized application. For more detailed information on each contract, please refer to the respective documentation and code comments.
